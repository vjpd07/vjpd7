<p>Varun Mayya’s new project/company/venture(man just does things love him for it) is extremely good. It was announced last night and in myopinion it will be a success. Maybe not financially though.</p>
<p> There is a very small market for AAA titles in India since there is very low access to rigs that can play games made at that level. People generally see them as toys more or less and aren’t really willing to buy it. There is a very blackpilled community for everything(usually on reddit) that seems to hate anything new and exciting and people who aren’t blackpilled get influenced to be blackpilled because they keep seeing it creating a vicious cycle of public(hater) opinion on anyone doing anything new and different adding pressure onto teams slowly leading to an ngmi project.</p>
<p>A lot of people on X are saying that something like “Mumbai Gullies” could happen to it. They wanted to build an Indian GTA(open world, story driven game) and these guys are trying to build an Indian Dark Souls/ Sun Wu Kong (Souls Like Combat game).</p>
<p> All of these criticisms I mentioned are true. But looking at the amount of stuff Varun put out on the team and the amount of work they did I don’t think it applies to them. You don’t block out a whole city to scan it if you’re not dedicated to the idea. Its clear the origin for this project comes from the literal ‘love of the game’. I’ve followed Varun since I was in like 8th grade and his message has always been to do it for the love of the game. The amount of dedication put into this project issomething you can see for yourself. Could it have been faked? Sure. I’d be surprised to hear it but it could be. I also don’t think this is another Mumbai Gullies since there’s a lot more people working on this and most of them appear to be skilled at their job.</p> 
<p> If their goal was to make a AAA game that could potentially rival other international major game studios’ projects in terms of quality - I think they will succeed.I still wouldn’t be sure if it would be a major success financially(but I’m just an 18 yo kid writing this from his room and i haven’t done anything of much significance in life so I’m not the best source to knowthat).</p>
<p> I think this project will still be a major opener for a new industry in India. even if its not a major success financially I think it will be big enough where making a AAA title in India will seem viable. A lot of talented people who did not see gamedev as a viable path in India who would either leave the country or just decide not to pursue it would see it differently. <strong>Actual talent in India staying in India and growing to make things.</strong> I think that should be the goal for anyone who wants India to win. And I think this will be a stepping stone in that</p>
<p> </p>
<p>P.S If you have no clue wth i'm on<link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Csd_qZyt3c&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fvjpd07.github.io%2F&source_ve_path=Mjg2NjMsMjg2NjY">

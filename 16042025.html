<h1 id="bullish-on-11a">The Era Of Addiction</h1>
<h6>16/04/2025</h6>
<p>We've all got a preference for a scroll app now. literally everyone. it could be twitter, instagram, tik tok, watch mojo, youtube shorts, josh....</p>
<p>There's just an incredible plethora of them and we've as a species have got a severe addiction of them. You can go on reels and you can find shit from the most remote parts of Africa talking about the most pointless shit on them. </p>
<p>Everyone has their own version it could be
  - X - for the retard who thinks he's the shit(I'm one of the retards)
  - Instagram - for the guy who 'likes dark humour' which is just non creative racism which isn't even funny/ the of model trying to get the dark humour guy to sub to her page
  - TikTok - Its banned in India but its seems to be filled with emo kids ig
  - YTShorts or even just YT - for the 5yo who just got a tablet
  We all like our favourite flavours and some of us like to mix chocolate with butterscotch. </p>
<p>I think everyone knows these apps are meant to be addicting to the midwit(no matter how much I larp that my iq is 127 I am probably still a midwit). We all know about dopamine and its affects. We all know about decreasing attention span. You're gonna spend 3,4,5,6,7,8 and I've seen people with more hours on these apps. </p>
<p>And it isn't just vertical short form content its also porn, games, vapes, weed, smoking. Pretty much every addiction except alcohol has been increasing in Genz and millenials(I don't even want to think how cooked generation alpha is most of them are barely out of primary school). Betting apps have been seeing a huge surge in popularity in the past 1-2 years with popular streamers like XQC, Kai Cenat, Adin Ross and a lot of smaller have just been playing weird crossy road ripoffs on Stake gambling their life on a a chicken crossing a road. You watch the IPL and pretty much after every single over most of the ads you see are for fantasy sports app. Which are worse than normal gambling in my opinion because they keep  getting away by calling themselves games of skill when in fact they are games of chance. The future can be predicted but its not certain it will always be right. There is always a 0.1% chance of the underdog winning. Even if the chances are high dosen't mean the outcome will pay out.</p>
<p>We all know these things so I'm not going to speak on their effects much here. I think i've found a much more better solution far bigger than the site blockers, the dumbphones and the second brains. I want to start with a story</p>
<p>I decided to just completely switch to a 'dumbphone' in January 2024 its a Nokia Music 105 which can barely play music it can't even play lossless idk why they advertised it as a music phone. But If I'm being honest this barely worked to fix anything. At the time i was an insta retard and the aim of this phone was to lower the consumption. Instead of  watching Reels on the small rectangle i started watching reels on the folding rectangle with buttons on it(my laptop). This to say the least, was a challenge. I couldn't give up my laptop cuz of my studies so I just decided to delete my insta account. This also did nothing. The next thing i knew i was addicted to ytshorts brainrot and yt in general.</p>
<p>Now you might think "Damn this guy is either really stupid or just cooked". I would like to say i'm both respectfully. Lets look at what's going on in the background of all this. I'm currently in class 12th. i just had an incredibly difficult 11th grade. For someone who had never gotten lower than 70% in any test ever in his life failing 2 tests and barely passing almost all of them it was difficult. My father had suggested me to take admission in coaching classes for the JEE exam(imagine cram schools in Japan) at the end of class 10th which is something you pretty much will give if you decide to study engineering in India even if its not a requirement. I was a resistant getting into it because I really wanted to pursue the humanities but i maybe gave this resistance up after i started really getting into physics after 6 months into classes. 'i do like coding(writing basic high school level python cli applications) and i am liking one of the 3 big subjects maybe it isn't that bad' I thought.  This is also the time around which i started to do a bit better. I got the 2nd highest marks in a physics test i was doing pretty well in maths classes suddenly too. the only issue i had was chemistry and pretty much every other subject i was having fun in. This was also when the addiction was at the least. I got the dumbphone in January and then 12th started and shit was going pretty good even then. But then some dumb shit happened. My Physics Teacher just dipped in the middle of the year and was replaced by a newbie teacher. My physics teacher was really important to me i don't think i would like physics as much as i do today if it wasn't for him so there was obviously emotion present to it. But to add to this the new teacher had this heavy bihari accent which most of the class outside of one kid understood and whenenver I went to ask doubts to him he would just more or less be non helpful. i barely understood his explantions and i probably would be better of reading the text than listening to sounds that come out of his mouth. But nonetheless i still want to be an engineer. This leads us to the past week. My JEE has pretty much been cooked i don't expect any return on it, however i did take a crash course from mathongo for bitsat and this has probably been the most productive week of my life because i really really want to go to bits pilani/ goa.</p>
<p>Now what does my long tangent about the past 2 years tell us anything about the solution for addiction. It's purpose. Its just purpose. Most young people don't have a purpose in life. You don't know things and there's too many things to know around you so you just crash out and then cope by falling into addictions. The thing in my story is that i lacked purpose. motivation helped me just do things but before purpose i was ass. i have a purpose now and it seems to be going really well for me. I don't think it will be much different for any other teenager. You just need purpose. the apps can help but they're just cope usually. i'm thinking of switching back to smartphone now the dumbphone is just not worth it</p>
